  The planner block buffer is planned assuming constant acceleration velocity profiles and are
  continuously joined at block junctions as shown above. However, the planner only actively computes
  the block entry speeds for an optimal velocity plan, but does not compute the block internal
  velocity profiles. These velocity profiles are computed ad-hoc as they are executed by the
  stepper algorithm and consists of only 7 possible types of profiles: cruise-only, cruise-
  deceleration, acceleration-cruise, acceleration-only, deceleration-only, full-trapezoid, and
  triangle(no cruise).

/* "The Stepper Driver Interrupt" - This timer interrupt is the workhorse of Grbl. Grbl employs
   the venerable Bresenham line algorithm to manage and exactly synchronize multi-axis moves.
   Unlike the popular DDA algorithm, the Bresenham algorithm is not susceptible to numerical
   round-off errors and only requires fast integer counters, meaning low computational overhead
   and maximizing the Arduino's capabilities. However, the downside of the Bresenham algorithm
   is, for certain multi-axis motions, the non-dominant axes may suffer from un-smooth step
   pulse trains, or aliasing, which can lead to strange audible noises or shaking. This is
   particularly noticeable or may cause motion issues at low step frequencies (0-5kHz), but
   is usually not a physical problem at higher frequencies, although audible.
     To improve Bresenham multi-axis performance, Grbl uses what we call an Adaptive Multi-Axis
   Step Smoothing (AMASS) algorithm, which does what the name implies. At lower step frequencies,
   AMASS artificially increases the Bresenham resolution without affecting the algorithm's
   innate exactness. AMASS adapts its resolution levels automatically depending on the step
   frequency to be executed, meaning that for even lower step frequencies the step smoothing
   level increases. Algorithmically, AMASS is acheived by a simple bit-shifting of the Bresenham
   step count for each AMASS level. For example, for a Level 1 step smoothing, we bit shift
   the Bresenham step event count, effectively multiplying it by 2, while the axis step counts
   remain the same, and then double the stepper ISR frequency. In effect, we are allowing the
   non-dominant Bresenham axes step in the intermediate ISR tick, while the dominant axis is
   stepping every two ISR ticks, rather than every ISR tick in the traditional sense. At AMASS
   Level 2, we simply bit-shift again, so the non-dominant Bresenham axes can step within any
   of the four ISR ticks, the dominant axis steps every four ISR ticks, and quadruple the
   stepper ISR frequency. And so on. This, in effect, virtually eliminates multi-axis aliasing
   issues with the Bresenham algorithm and does not significantly alter Grbl's performance, but
   in fact, more efficiently utilizes unused CPU cycles overall throughout all configurations.
     AMASS retains the Bresenham algorithm exactness by requiring that it always executes a full
   Bresenham step, regardless of AMASS Level. Meaning that for an AMASS Level 2, all four
   intermediate steps must be completed such that baseline Bresenham (Level 0) count is always
   retained. Similarly, AMASS Level 3 means all eight intermediate steps must be executed.
   Although the AMASS Levels are in reality arbitrary, where the baseline Bresenham counts can
   be multiplied by any integer value, multiplication by powers of two are simply used to ease
   CPU overhead with bitshift integer operations.
     This interrupt is simple and dumb by design. All the computational heavy-lifting, as in
   determining accelerations, is performed elsewhere. This interrupt pops pre-computed segments,
   defined as constant velocity over n number of steps, from the step segment buffer and then
   executes them by pulsing the stepper pins appropriately via the Bresenham algorithm. This
   ISR is supported by The Stepper Port Reset Interrupt which it uses to reset the stepper port
   after each pulse. The bresenham line tracer algorithm controls all stepper outputs
   simultaneously with these two interrupts.

   NOTE: This interrupt must be as efficient as possible and complete before the next ISR tick,
   which for Grbl must be less than 33.3usec (@30kHz ISR rate). Oscilloscope measured time in
   ISR is 5usec typical and 25usec maximum, well below requirement.
   NOTE: This ISR expects at least one step to be executed per segment.

       NOTE: Steps are computed by direct scalar conversion of the millimeter distance
       remaining in the block, rather than incrementally tallying the steps executed per
       segment. This helps in removing floating point round-off issues of several additions.
       However, since floats have only 7.2 significant digits, long moves with extremely
       high step counts can exceed the precision of floats, which can lead to lost steps.
       Fortunately, this scenario is highly unlikely and unrealistic in CNC machines
       supported by Grbl (i.e. exceeding 10 meters axis travel at 200 step/mm).

/*
   TODO: With feedrate overrides, increases to the override value will not significantly
     change the current planner and stepper operation. When the value increases, we simply
     need to recompute the block plan with new nominal speeds and maximum junction velocities.
     However with a decreasing feedrate override, this gets a little tricky. The current block
     plan is optimal, so if we try to reduce the feed rates, it may be impossible to create
     a feasible plan at its current operating speed and decelerate down to zero at the end of
     the buffer. We first have to enforce a deceleration to meet and intersect with the reduced
     feedrate override plan. For example, if the current block is cruising at a nominal rate
     and the feedrate override is reduced, the new nominal rate will now be lower. The velocity
     profile must first decelerate to the new nominal rate and then follow on the new plan.
        Another issue is whether or not a feedrate override reduction causes a deceleration
     that acts over several planner blocks. For example, say that the plan is already heavily
     decelerating throughout it, reducing the feedrate override will not do much to it. So,
     how do we determine when to resume the new plan? One solution is to tie into the feed hold
     handling code to enforce a deceleration, but check when the current speed is less than or
     equal to the block maximum speed and is in an acceleration or cruising ramp. At this
     point, we know that we can recompute the block velocity profile to meet and continue onto
     the new block plan.
       One "easy" way to do this is to have the step segment buffer enforce a deceleration and
     continually re-plan the planner buffer until the plan becomes feasible. This can work
     and may be easy to implement, but it expends a lot of CPU cycles and may block out the
     rest of the functions from operating at peak efficiency. Still the question is how do
     we know when the plan is feasible in the context of what's already in the code and not
     require too much more code?
